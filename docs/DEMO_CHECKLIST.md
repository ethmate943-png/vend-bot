# Demo Checklist

Send this to yourself as a reminder before any live demo.

---

## 30 minutes before demo

- [ ] Restart the server fresh
- [ ] Send **DEMO: [their number]** to clear their session (if you have this command)
- [ ] Confirm all systems green: **GET /health/systems** (db, groq, kimi, paystack, inventory)
- [ ] Check API rate limits not exhausted
- [ ] Make sure demo vendor has at least 3 items in stock
- [ ] Test the full flow yourself on a different number
- [ ] Have the store link ready to send them instantly

---

## During demo

- [ ] Send them the store link yourself — don't make them find it
- [ ] Tell them exactly what to type first
- [ ] Have a backup script if something breaks: *"Let me just restart quickly"* buys you 30 seconds

---

## If it breaks

- [ ] Don't panic — laugh it off, you're building
- [ ] *"This is exactly the kind of edge case we're fixing"*
- [ ] Pivot to showing the code or the architecture instead
- [ ] End with what **IS** working, not what broke
